## GrÃ¼ezi!

Hey there, I'm Nico, a software developer from Indonesia, currently residing in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. My present tech stack includes React (with Next.js or Remix), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Node.js.

Previously, I developed iOS apps using Objective-C and Swift, as well as Android apps using React Native.

I have a strong passion for testing, debugging, and writing documentation! You can find the open source projects I'm proud of [here](/opensource).

Follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nico.fyi) and [GitHub](https://github.com/nicnocquee)! You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/2co_p) but as of November 2024, I'm hanging out more on BlueSky. Or if you're into cats, you can find my cats on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@yakisobanekotachi) ðŸ˜¸.
