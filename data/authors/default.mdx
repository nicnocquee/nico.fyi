## GrÃ¼ezi!

Hey there, I'm Nico, a software developer from Indonesia currently residing in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. My current tech stack includes React (with Next.js or Remix), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Node.js.

Previously, I developed iOS apps using Objective-C and Swift, as well as Android apps with React Native.

I have a strong passion for testing, debugging, and writing documentation! Check out some of my work for my employers [here](/works). I also have some open-source projects that I'm proud of [here](/opensource).

Follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nico.fyi) and [GitHub](https://github.com/nicnocquee)! Or, if you're into cats, you can find mine on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@yakisobanekotachi) ðŸ˜¸.
