In the company I work for, there are some team members who wanted to be notified when a new release is deployed to production. Since we use GitHub, I can easily set up a step in our GitHub Actions workflow to send an e-mail to the team member when a new release is created.

```yml:deploy.yml {20-43} showLineNumbers
name: Deploy to production websites
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  release:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Cancel Previous Runs
        uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.9.1
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Updating release
        run: |
          echo "Release the new version"
          # Do something like push to Vercel
      - name: Send email
        uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3
        with:
          server_address: smtp.fastmail.com
          server_port: 465
          username: ${{ secrets.FASTMAIL_EMAIL }}
          password: ${{ secrets.FASTMAIL_PASSWORD }}
          subject: New Release of Our Awesome project
          html_body: |
            A new release has been published!

            Release: ${{ github.event.release.name }}
            Version: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
            Link: ${{ github.event.release.html_url }}

            Description:

            ${{ github.event.release.body }}

            The Markdown in this email will be automatically converted to HTML.

          to: member1@example.com,member2@example.com,myemail@example.com
          from: myemail@example.com
          convert_markdown: true
```

We use [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com) in the company so I can just create a new App Password and add it to GitHub Secrets (`FASTMAIL_EMAIL` and `FASTMAIL_PASSWORD`) which is used by the "Send email" step above.
