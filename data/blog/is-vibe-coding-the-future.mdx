I recently stumbled upon the term "vibe coding" through TikTok videos. It refers to using AI tools to generate code and drag-and-drop automation tools to handle business logic in apps.

This trend leaves me with mixed feelings. While it's impressive to see people rapidly creating apps and generating significant income, **it's concerning that many don't understand the underlying code**. Tools like Cursor, Copilot, Supermaven, and N8N have made app creation accessible to anyone, regardless of coding knowledge.

As an experienced developer, I find myself hesitant to fully embrace these AI tools because I'm particular about code quality. My experiments with AI app builders like v0 and Bolt.new often result in code that doesn't meet my standards and contains TypeScript errors requiring manual fixes. Meanwhile, those new to development seem unbothered by these issues as long as their apps function. Some even claimed that they have made tens of thousands of dollars from the apps the AI built.

I believe vibe coders miss out on valuable learning experiences. **The process of debugging and understanding mistakes while learning new frameworks has been crucial to my growth as a developer**.

This rise of vibe coding raises several important questions:

- Has project documentation become obsolete when AI can explain any codebase?
- Does code readability and maintainability still matter if AI can interpret and explain everything?
- What's the future for web/app developers? While framework and low-level developers might be safe, those building applications on top might face challenges as AI tools evolve.

**The main issue with vibe coding is maintainability**. When problems arise, developers who don't understand their codebase will struggle to fix issues. It's similar to constructing a building without construction knowledge – it might work initially, but problems become overwhelming when they surface.

However, I acknowledge the democratizing effect of vibe coding. It's enabling individuals with ideas to build and launch products without traditional coding barriers, which has merit.

The future likely involves a hybrid approach. Rather than writing every line manually, we'll focus more on architectural decisions and proper implementation while leveraging AI for routine tasks. Think of AI as a capable assistant – you still need to direct the project and understand its fundamentals.

The reality is that vibe coding will persist alongside traditional development practices. Success will lie in balancing AI-assisted development with fundamental coding knowledge. After all, when AI-generated code fails, someone needs to understand how to resolve the issues.
