This post is just a quick reminder of how to generate subtitles from video using [subtitles-generator](https://github.com/avivharuzi/subtitles-generator) in a single command.

```shell
npx subtitles-generator -i /path/to/video.mp4 -m base.en
```

It works pretty well. The first time you run it, it would take a while to download the model. But after that, it's super fast. It's also super easy to use.

Since I don't use it often, I put this up in my blog so I can easily find it again.
