Some people seem to hate the file-based routing in Next.js. They prefer to use code-based routing instead. And with [Remix, a.k.a, React Router 7](https://x.com/remix_run/status/1841926043080523813) is going to release the new config based routing, many people seem to be excited about it.

But many don't seem to know that it has been possible to do code-based routing in Next.js. You just have to use the [optional catch-all segments of the dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments) and library like [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp).

First, create a file in `app/[[...paths]]/page.tsx`:

```typescript:app/[[...paths]]/page.tsx {6-9, 26-36} showLineNumbers
import UserIdPage from "@/page-components/user-id";
import UsersPage from "@/page-components/users";
import { match } from "path-to-regexp";

// define your routes here
const routes = [
  { matcher: match("/users/:userId"), component: UserIdPage },
  { matcher: match("/users"), component: UsersPage },
] as const;

export default function CatchAll({
  params,
}: {
  params?: { paths?: string[] };
}) {
  if (!params?.paths) return <div>Main page</div>;

  let route:
    | {
        component: React.ElementType;
        params: Record<string, unknown> | undefined;
        path: string[];
      }
    | undefined;

  for (const r of routes) {
    const matched = r.matcher(`/${params.paths.join("/")}`);
    if (matched) {
      route = {
        component: r.component,
        params: matched.params,
        path: params.paths,
      };
      break;
    }
  }

  if (route) {
    return <route.component {...route.params} />;
  }

  return <div>CatchAll: {params.paths.join("/")}</div>;
}
```

What's cool about this is that you can still use the file-based routing in the `app` directory if you want. So if you have a file in `app/admins/page.tsx`, you can still use it as `/admins` in the URL.

Furthermore, you don't actually need to use this code-based routing approach from the root URL. You can use it from some other nested paths like `app/dashboard/[[...paths]]/page.tsx` and it will work as expected.
