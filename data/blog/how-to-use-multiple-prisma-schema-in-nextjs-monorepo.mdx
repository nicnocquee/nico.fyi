Monorepos have come a long way since the days of Lerna. When I tried them before, it was painful. Lots of things were not working as expected. But now, it's a lot better. I've been using [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) for a while now and it's been great. It got me to the point where I always want to start a new project with it.

However, there are still some things that don't just work. One of those things is having [Prisma as a shared package in a monorepo](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/turborepo#1-create-your-monorepo-using-turborepo). When a Next.js app in the monorepo uses the shared Prisma package, you'll run into runtime errors when deployed to serverless environments like Vercel or Netlify.

```
This is likely caused by a bundler that has not copied
"libquery_engine-rhel-openss1-3.0.x.so.node" next to the resulting bundle.
Ensure that "libquery_engine-rhel-openss1-3.0.x.so.node" has been copied next to the bundle or in "generated/client".
```

This happens because the Next.js compiler does not copy all the files from the prisma-generated-client directory to the output directory of the Next.js app. This is a known issue and can be fixed by using the [@prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin). After installing the npm package, update the `next.config.mjs` file to include the plugin.

```tsx:next.config.mjs
const { PrismaPlugin } = require('@prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin')

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    if (isServer) {
      config.plugins = [...config.plugins, new PrismaPlugin()]
    }

    return config
  },
}
```

This has worked wonderfully for me in my projects. **Until I started using multiple Prisma schemas in the same monorepo**. In my project, I added another package to the monorepo that contains another Prisma schema which connects to a different database. I did this because the data in the second database is completely unrelated to the first one. So, in the spirit of separation of concerns, I decided to keep them in separate packages.

But when the Next.js app uses both Prisma packages, I hit the same error as before despite having the plugin installed. After reading the code of the plugin, I found that it basically just copies the files from the prisma-generated-client directory to the output directory of the Next.js app. But it doesn't handle the case where there are multiple Prisma schemas and prisma-generated-client directories. So all I had to do was modify the plugin to handle this case. And here's the modified plugin. It's a bit long, so you can just copy and paste it into your project.

```js:prisma-monorepo-workaround-plugin.js
import path from "path";
import fs from "fs/promises";
// Use require for webpack types to avoid breaking if types are not installed
let CompilationType, SourcesType;
try {
  const webpack = require("webpack");
  CompilationType = webpack.Compilation;
  SourcesType = webpack.sources;
} catch {
  CompilationType = undefined;
  SourcesType = undefined;
}

// when client is bundled this gets its output path
// regex works both on escaped and non-escaped code
const prismaDirRegex =
  /\\?"?output\\?"?:\s*{(?:\\n?|\s)*\\?"?value\\?"?:(?:\\n?|\s)*\\?"(.*?)\\?",(?:\\n?|\s)*\\?"?fromEnvVar\\?"?/g;

async function getPrismaDir(from) {
  // if we can find schema.prisma in the path, we are done
  if (await fs.stat(path.join(from, "schema.prisma")).catch(() => false)) {
    return from;
  }

  // otherwise we need to find the generated prisma client
  return path.dirname(require.resolve(".prisma/client", { paths: [from] }));
}

// get all required prisma files (schema + engine)
async function getPrismaFiles(from) {
  const prismaDir = await getPrismaDir(from);
  const filterRegex = /schema\.prisma|engine/;
  const prismaFiles = await fs.readdir(prismaDir);

  return prismaFiles.filter((file) => file.match(filterRegex));
}

class MultiPrismaPlugin {

    this.options = options;

          });

          await Promise.all(jsAsyncActions);
        },
      );
    });

    // update nft.json files to include prisma files (only for next.js)
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap("MultiPrismaPlugin", (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.processAssets.tapPromise(

            return fs.copyFile(from, dest);
          }

      );

      await Promise.all(asyncActions);
    });
  }
}

export { MultiPrismaPlugin };
```

Put that in a file called `prisma-monorepo-workaround-plugin.js` somewhere in your Next.js app. Then update the `next.config.mjs` file to use the plugin.

```tsx:next.config.mjs
const { MultiPrismaPlugin } = require('./prisma-monorepo-workaround-plugin')

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    if (isServer) {
      config.plugins = [...config.plugins, new MultiPrismaPlugin()]
```

Then you can try to build the Next.js app and see if it works by checking the output directory. If it works, you will see multiple schema files and the `libquery_engine-*.node` file in the output directory. Try running the following command to see if it works:

```bash
find apps/your-next-js-app/.next -name 'schema.prisma*'
find apps/your-next-js-app/.next -name '*.node'
```

If you see multiple schema files and the `libquery_engine-*.node` file, then you're good to go.

I might publish this plugin to npm so you can use it in your projects. But for now, you can use the code above in your projects.
